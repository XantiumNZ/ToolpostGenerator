# ToolpostGenerator
## An open source recreation of the software that powered ToolpostBot.

This is a rewrite of the software that powered ToolpostBot since February 2018 up until some time in early 2019. It used to run off a Batch script. I won't put anyone through that, so here's a Node.js rewrite based off the ToolpostBot Discord bot source.

**Designed for Windows.**

### Dependencies
- Knowledge on how to setup Node.js and all the other shit needed to make this work.
- ffmpeg and ffprobe in your %PATH% or in the directory of `toolpostgenerator.js`. You can get these executables from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html.

### How to Use
- You need Node.js from https://nodejs.org.
- In the same directory as `toolpostgenerator.js`, you need a source MP4 as the video for your generation. Call this `source.mp4`. For best results, don't make it too long.
- Then again in the same directory as `toolpostgenerator.js`, you need a `sourcemp3` directory, with ideally as many MP3 files as possible, for maximum randomness. The script will ignore MP3s shorter than the video source.
- Run the batch file `toolpostgenerator.bat` (or run command `node toolpostgenerator.js`) to see it work.

### Contributions
Please feel free to make contributions! Refactors, bug fixes, grammar correcting, anything! Please do not judge my code too much!
